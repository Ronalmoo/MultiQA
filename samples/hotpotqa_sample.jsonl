The first series of these books was the \"Perfect Works\" series, written and published by Square subsidiary DigiCube.  They produced three books between 1998 and 1999 before the line was stopped in favor of the \"Ultimania\" (\u30a2\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30de\u30cb\u30a2 , Arutimania ) series, a portmanteau of ultimate and mania.  This series of books is written by Studio BentStuff, which had previously written game guides for Square for \"Final Fantasy VII\".  They were published by DigiCube until the company was dissolved in 2003.  Square merged with video game publisher Enix on April 1, 2003 to form Square Enix, which resumed publication of the companion books. ",

Carnell edited both magazines until Nova went out of business in early 1964.  The titles were acquired by Roberts & Vinter, who hired Kyril Bonfiglioli to edit \"Science Fantasy\"; Bonfiglioli changed the title to \"Impulse\" in early 1966, but the new title led to confusion with the distributors and sales fell, though the magazine remained profitable.  The title was changed again to \"SF Impulse\" for the last few issues.  \"Science Fantasy\" ceased publication the following year, when Roberts & Vinter came under financial pressure after their printer went bankrupt.

An inscription on the minbar (\u0645\u0646\u0628\u0631) or the pulpit testifies to fact that the mosque was built in 1097.  It is also known by several other names such as Grand Mosque d'Alger, Djamaa al-Kebir, El Kebir Mosque and Jami Masjid.  It is one of the few remaining examples of Almoravid architecture.  It is the oldest mosque in Algiers and is said to be the oldest mosque in Algeria after Sidi Okba Mosque.  It was built under sultan Ali ibn Yusuf.  Its minaret dates from 1332 (1324 in some sources) and was built by the Ziyyanid Sultan of Tlemcen.  The gallery at the outside of the mosque was built in 1840.  Its construction was a consequence of a complete reconstruction of the street by the French. ",

AT that time it was basically a gentlemen's club of members who were interested in all types of model building.  In 1926 the Society was formalized and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York.  This was done so that the Society could obtain a permit to use a lake in New York City's Central Park for model motor boat races.  It was also at this time that the Society began construction of its first Model Railroad \" The Union Connecting\".  Over the next twenty years, the Society moved from its original location to two other locations.  Each move doubling the size of the previous location and of course doubling the size of the model train layout.  During WW2 many Society members were called to service in the Armed Forces.  Regrettably, the largest of the layouts had to be dismantled.  The location of the layout in the basement of the Astor Building was requested for the war effort.  The dismantling was done with care, with salvaged usable materials going into scrap drives for the War effort.  As members returned after the War a new location was searched for.  This led to an invitation from the Lackawanna Railroad to move into their Passenger Terminal in Hoboken,NJ.  They had the space for what would become the largest model railroad in the world at that time.  The space?  Only the ornate waiting room for the recently discontinued ferry boats to 23rd Street in New York City.  Here the layout was built.  It was based on the Lackawanna Railroad from Hoboken to Scranton, Pa.  It was magnificent; from the scale model of the Hoboken Terminal to the soaring Delaware Water Gap.  During the early-1950s the organization moved to its current location in Carlstadt, New Jersey. ",
